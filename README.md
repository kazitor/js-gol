# js-gol
A fairly simple simulator of Conway's Gamoe of Life based cellular automata. If you're really interested in this sort of thing, I highly recommend [golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net).

## Usage
Click within the display to toggle individual cells. Once you're done, press "Step" to advance a frame, or "Start" to advance 10 times a second.

## Compatibility
Works with Internet Explorer 11 (and probably a few versions below), so it ought to work with everything.
